# to_do_list 

### This is a flutter project that i made using the knowledge that i gain in my flutter class.

It's a basic to do list, very simple and effective, that i think i needed for myself, just to remember a few things and do others, so i realized that i could do with all that i learned from my flutter class, and did it.

### It's design is very basic and simple, so it's likely to change someday

### Here some gifs of it working:
